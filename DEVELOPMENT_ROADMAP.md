### Phase 4: Testing, Documentation, and Deployment

#### 9. Testing (Priority: High)
- Write unit tests for core modules
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Implement test data generation
- Set up CI pipeline
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

#### 10. API Documentation (Priority: Medium)
- Create Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Document all endpoints and parameters
- Add usage examples
- Create sequence diagrams for flows
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

#### 11. Deployment (Priority: Medium)
- Optimize Docker configuration
- Create production deployment scripts
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Implement database backup strategy
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

## Implementation Guidelines for Cursor AI

### Development Approach
1. Follow a modular approach - complete one module before moving to the next
2. Build incrementally - implement core functionality before adding advanced features
3. Focus on code quality and reusability
4. Maintain consistent error handling and logging
5. Document code with JSDoc comments

### Implementation Order
For each module, follow this implementation sequence:
1. Complete the model (if not already done)
2. Implement service layer business logic
3. Create controller methods
4. Set up routes with proper middleware
5. Test the implementation
6. Document the API endpoints

### Code Review Checklist
Before marking a task as complete, ensure:
- All required validations are in place
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Security considerations are addressed
- Code is well-documented
- Naming is consistent and descriptive
- No unnecessary dependencies are introduced

## Getting Started for Cursor AI

1. Review existing codebase to understand the structure
2. Start with completing the User Management module
3. Follow with Fleet and Shipment Management
4. Update the TASKS.md file as you progress
5. Refer to CURSOR_AI_GUIDE.md for specific implementation guidance

## Technical Details to Consider

### Authentication & Authorization
- All protected routes should use the `protect` middleware
- Role-based access control using the `restrictTo` middleware
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Secure password handling and storage

### Database Operations
- Use Mongoose features for validation
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Create indexes for frequently queried fields
- Use transactions for operations that modify multiple collections

### API Design
- Follow RESTful principles
- Use consistent response formats
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Add filtering capabilities where appropriate

### Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Secure file uploads with validation
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Sanitize data before returning to clients

## Next Steps

1. Review all the existing models and services
2. Complete the missing controller functions for authentication
3. Implement the truck management endpoints
4. Create the shipment management functionality
5. Build the application/bid system
6. Continue with the remaining modules according to the priority

This roadmap should be regularly updated as development progresses. Tasks can be adjusted based on changing requirements or priorities.
