# Development Tasks for Delivery App

This document outlines the implementation tasks for the Delivery App project. It serves as a guide and progress tracker for Cursor AI and developers.

## Guidelines for Cursor AI

### General Rules
- Read the existing code before implementing new features to maintain consistency
- Follow the established folder structure and naming conventions
- Write clear comments and documentation for your implementations
- Include appropriate error handling and validation

- Use async/await patterns for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper logging for important operations
- Follow RESTful API design principles

### Code Style
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for class names and model names
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Indent with 2 spaces
- Include JSDoc comments for functions and methods
- Group related code in logical sections with comments
